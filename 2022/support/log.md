We have been running into sporadic, severe issues with stateless agent availability since we [rolled out stateless builds to 75% of `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` builds](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32751). See [thread](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02MWRMAFR8/p1647838869486089). Caused some severe downtime in the morning, with [incident 92](https://app.incident.io/incidents/92)

- Increased `backoffLimit` to max: https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/pull/3176
- Discussed autoscaling implementation, landed on some misunderstandings: https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/pull/3177
- Scaled down agent rollout top 10%: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32840

Follow-up: potential revamp of autoscaler. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/32843

- Node installation failures in deploy-sourcegraph-cloud pipeline [thread](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02KX975BDG/p1647971014157899?thread_ts=1647957942.367989&cid=C02KX975BDG)
  - Might be caused by really old Node version in the pipeline, or just plain bad state. Doesn't seem to be happening on the sourcegraph pipeline
  - @daxmc99 deletes a bunch of stuff propagated from upstream depoy-sourcegraph, as well as the prettier step entirely: https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-cloud/pull/15935

To roll back, revert https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/33107 or change the queue to target `stateless` instead of `stateless2`. Configuration changes are in https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/pull/3182
