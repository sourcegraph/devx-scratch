## 22-06-29 GCP Cost Reduction and CD improvements
Kalan:
Working with Daniel and Manny to identify areas of improvement to dotcom and preprod deployments
- TLDR; commits in preprod branch get squashed and causes conflicts when more image tags get changed and need to be merged into release(main) again. 
- Potential fix wouild be to run Github Actions that creates a brand new brand on run time instead of having renovate make updates to preprod. Could incorporate `sg` usage here instead of writing custom script. Dax has some progress [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-cloud/pull/16390), but it's not perfect due to formatting/linting issues.

Regarding GCP cost reductions, we'll tackle the low hanging fruit first identified by RafG in his [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQScUkS6fyBfW__dG0WiHmXH6-Fl_4zWwMTY9IWASSI/edit#heading=h.na988urmj90p).

- get understanding of usage vs provisioned resources
- identify peak periods and consumption
- involve targetted service's stakeholders to see if we can reduce infrastructure provisioning
- build foundations for FinOps. [FinOps is to Dollars What DevOps is to Code](https://devops.com/how-finops-can-optimize-cloud-costs-and-drive-innovation/)

## 22-06-29 Dotcom crashed due to invalid site config
Opened a [PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-cloud/pull/17063) addressing invalid JSON and YAML that gets committed and deployed. In this case, it led to brief interruptions of sourcegraph.com.
