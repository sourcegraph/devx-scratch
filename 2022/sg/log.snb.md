# 2022 general `sg` hacking log

DevX teammates hacking on `sg` log. To add an entry, just add an H2 header starting with the ISO 8601 format, a topic.
**This log should be in reverse chronological order.**

Last week we had a discussion around scripting in Go. We're opting to introduce a new library, [`github.com/sourcegraph/run`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/run), that provides a builder pattern for executing commands and operating on their output in a programmatic manner - WIP example:

```go
// Export lines
lines, _ := run.Cmd(ctx, "ls").Run().Lines()
for i, l := range lines {
    fmt.Printf("line %d: %q\n", i, l)
}

// Render new README file
var readmeData bytes.Buffer
_ = run.Cmd(ctx, "cat", "README.md").Run().Stream(&readmeData)
replaced := exampleBlockRegexp.ReplaceAll(readmeData.Bytes(), exampleData.Bytes())

// Pipe modified data to command
_ = run.Cmd(ctx, "cp /dev/stdin README.md").Input(bytes.NewReader(replaced)).Run().Wait()

// Or, just pipe Output directly  to another command!
lsOut := run.Cmd(ctx, "ls cmd").Run().
    Filter(func(line []byte) ([]byte, bool) {
        return append([]byte("./cmd/"), line...), false
    })
_ = run.Cmd(ctx, "cat").Input(lsOut).Run().
    Stream(os.Stdout)
```

Also, related to the previous `sg analytics` discussion, just landed [dev/sg: track local sg analytics that can be submitted manually](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/35033) toda. Spoke with OkayHQ, was told these events will show up in UI after a feature update next week. Also confirmed we can allow users to not submit an identity. Maybe we can generate randomized identifiers.

I have been experimenting with [`github.com/bitfield/script`](https://github.com/bitfield/script). To date, the only usage that has stuck is [#34926](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/34926), and even that is debatable. Thoughts on why:

1. `run.InRoot`, `run.GitCmd`, etc. are already pretty good 75% of the time.
2. `scipt.Pipe()` semantics are really weird sometimes, especially with `Filter` etc, and you end up really question whether or not it's better to simply run commands one by one. Example: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/34680/files
3. Some things that are kind of important are missing, such as setting the execution context's directory, using `context.Context`, using `Exec` with `[]string`, and so on.
4. Most of the helpers don't really seem that useful when it comes down to it

@jhchabran had some thoughts here as well: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/discussions/33903#discussioncomment-2639015

I think for our use cases it might be simpler to build our own script pipeline thingo.

Potential integration with OkayHQ, geared towards identifying blockers/points of improvement, potentially useful features that could be exposed better, and/or unused features. Is being done at other companies.

Emphasis on not measuring productivity with `sg` analytics, but about things we can do to improve it.

Spike issue: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/33447

With Thorsten we completely reworked the installation and update process. It will always use the location of the binary as the source of truth.
The bootstrap process (the `curl ... | sh`) will suggest `~/.sg/sg` as the default location. This also led to the complete deprecation of the `./dev/sg/install.sh` script.

I merged the PR that replace the updates with a download of the prebuilt binary. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/33132

## 2022-03-22 `sg [...] open`

@bobheadxi

Idea brought up [Scratchpad - Improving engineering onboarding: tooling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NS_C3te-59P149LD_rrL1zcflNqqZOoSHVJfv8oPcqY/edit)

> we want to make the tools available discoverable

- added one for `sg ci` (https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32857)
- we don’t have `sg monitoring` yet, and we don’t even know if we will continue using Grafana going forward
- not much else to add?
