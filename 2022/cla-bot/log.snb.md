[David and Philip are merging the JetBrains PR](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C07KZF47K/p1650363090295009) in our monorepo and their PR cannot pass without the CLA-Bot approval. It's an egde case because those contributions are old and the `cla-bot` is triggered because we're importing the history of the repo they're importing the code from.
